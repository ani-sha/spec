# GraphQLCRUD

GraphQLCRUD is a GraphQL CRUD API specification for databases

Based on https://www.opencrud.org which is no longer maintained

## Rationale

GraphQL is a flexible query language supporting many different data access patterns. In practice, simple CRUD operations turn out to be a very common pattern. Standardising this very common pattern enables the community to build tooling specific to the common CRUD style API.
